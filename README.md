# For dataset2:
Please download the dataset2 through https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data. We only use stage1_train as our dataset. 

If you want to train our model with this dataset. Please create files  'dataset2/dataset/', 'dataset2/dataset/train/' and 
'dataset2/dataset/test/'. And remove the download zip file into 'dataset2/dataset/'.  

basicdata2.ipynb uses the basic unet as our training model. 

advanceddata2.ipynb uses the ResAttUnet as our training model.

# Video

We record the video of approximately 1 min for running the code. There are two videos, one for training ResattUnet with dataset1, another for training BasicUnet with dataset2.


Since we are not able to open GPU to run the code again video recording, therefore we use CPU to run instead, therefore the results could be a little bit different.
